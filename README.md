Well what I can tell about this fold...directory. The main thought is there are several miscellaneous
programming problems from the Coderbyte-service, (free and also non-free version exist) for which the solutions are
provivided by several familiar programming languages (C*:s (C and its children)), Java (Sun's version to simplify C++) and Python (where we do
need bash now?). The solutions are in no point meant to be most optimal, since the optimal solution to specific problem can be quite much more 
challenging to find than just feasible solution. I mean even buggy buggy, spaghetti code can still work most of time and after all that is what is wanted
in most cases. And in some cases it drops down the airplane...  But I really am developing skills :)
